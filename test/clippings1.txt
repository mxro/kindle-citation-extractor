Binof’s talking differently, Damaya realizes suddenly: her words evenly spaced and voice steady, her manner not so much haughty as grave. As if the world’s fate depends upon her finding the answer to her question. As if she isn’t just some spoiled girl from a powerful family who decided on a whim to do something incredibly stupid.

Capturing the biological bounty of an ancient plant, and the skills and huge markets of an old industry in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, European entrepreneurs and statesmen built an empire of cotton of tremendous scope and energy. Ironically, their shocking success also awakened the very forces that eventually would marginalize them within the empire they had created.

War capitalism relied on the capacity of rich and powerful Europeans to divide the world into an “inside” and an “outside.” The “inside” encompassed the laws, institutions, and customs of the mother country, where state-enforced order ruled. The “outside,” by contrast, was characterized by imperial domination, the expropriation of vast territories, decimation of indigenous peoples, theft of their resources, enslavement, and the domination of vast tracts of land by private capitalists with little effective oversight by distant European states.

Because of the different organization of households, especially limitations on women’s outside activities, female-dominated spinning had extremely low opportunity costs in India and China, making the embrace of new technologies less likely. Women’s labor, in the calculation of peasant households, was inexpensive.

Under both the hypothetical domestic cotton and the wool scenario, land and labor constraints would have made all but impossible the sudden expansion of cloth production. Perhaps even more decisively, such a scenario would have created unimaginable upheaval in the British and European countryside, whose social structure, like that of the Ottoman Empire and India, was not suited for such a massive and quick reallocation of land and labor. The elasticity of supply so essential to the Industrial Revolution thereby rested on reliable access to distant land and foreign labor. The ability of Europe’s states and their capitalists to rearrange global economic connections and to violently expropriate land and labor were as important, if not more important, to the ascendency of the West as the traditional explanations of technical inventiveness, cultural proclivities, and the geographical and climatic location of a small group of cotton manufacturers in a remote part of the British Isles.

Yet monopolies, subsidies, and the provision of expertise all proved to be fairly minor interventions, sufficient to allow the building of one factory or another, but not enough to embark upon the creation of a significant domestic cotton industry. Indeed, without the novel and powerful state in the heart of industrial capitalism, as we will see later, these efforts could easily fizzle. Much more important was a state’s ability to isolate its domestic manufacturing efforts from competition, especially from Britain.

Beyond protectionism, states also played a crucial role in market making by removing internal duties. The Catalonian industry benefited from the removal of internal tariff barriers in the Spanish market, as did the industry in the German lands after the creation of the Zollverein in 1834, which removed the myriad border crossings and tariff payments that had characterized trade in that part of the world.

Humans were like citizens of two worlds, occupying both the world of the Ding an sich (the thing-in-itself) which was the external world, and the internal world of one’s perception (how things ‘appeared’ to individuals). According to Kant, the ‘thing-in-itself’ could never be truly known, while the internal world was always subjective. What Kant brought to the table was the so-called transcendental level: the concept that when we experience an object, it becomes a ‘thing-as-it-appears-to-us’. Our senses as much as our reason are like tinted spectacles through which we perceive the world.

Humboldt wrote in Personal Narrative: ‘The beasts of the forest retire to the thickets; the birds hide themselves beneath the foliage of the trees, or in the crevices of the rocks. Yet, amid this apparent silence, when we lend an attentive ear to the most feeble sounds transmitted by the air, we hear a dull vibration, a continual murmur, a hum of insects, that fill, if we may use the expression, all the lower strata of the air. Nothing is better fitted to make man feel the extent and power of organic life. Myriads of insects creep upon the soil, and flutter round the plants parched by the ardour of the Sun. A confused noise issues from every bush, from the decayed trunks of trees, from the clefts of the rock, and from the ground undermined by the lizards, millepedes, and cecilias. There are so many voices proclaiming to us, that all nature breathes; and that, under a thousand different forms, life is diffused throughout the cracked and dusty soil, as well as in the bosom of the waters, and in the air that circulates around us.’

The only way to handle all this data was to be perfectly organized about the research. Humboldt collected his material in boxes which were divided by envelopes into different subjects. Whenever he received a letter, he cut out the important information and placed it in the relevant envelope together with any other scraps of material that might be useful – newspaper cuttings, pages from books, pieces of paper on which he scribbled a few numbers, a quotation or a little drawing. In one such box, for example, which was filled with material related to geology, Humboldt kept tables of mountain heights, maps, lecture notes, remarks from his old acquaintance Charles Lyell, a map of Russia by another British geologist, as well as engravings of fossils and information from classicists on geology from ancient Greece. The advantage of this system was that he could collect materials for years, and when it came to writing, all he needed was to grab the relevant box or the envelope. As untidy as he was in his study or chaotic about his finances, when it came to his research Humboldt was unremittingly exact.

Most visitors were surprised by the simplicity of Humboldt’s living arrangements: an apartment in a plain house not far from the university that his brother Wilhelm had founded. Whenever visitors arrived, they were welcomed by Seifert. He would take them to the second-floor flat where they would walk through a room filled with stuffed birds, rock specimens and other natural history objects, then on through the library and into the study where the walls were lined with yet more bookcases. The rooms overflowed with manuscripts and drawings, scientific instruments and more stuffed animals, as well as folios filled with pressed plants, rolled-up maps, busts, portraits and even a pet chameleon. There was a ‘magnificent’ leopard skin on the plain wooden floor. A parrot interrupted conversations when it shouted Humboldt’s most common instruction to his servant: ‘Much sugar, much coffee, Mr Seifert.’ Boxes cluttered the floor and the desk was surrounded by piles of books. A globe stood on one of the side tables in the library, and whenever Humboldt talked about a particular mountain, river or town he would get up and spin it. Humboldt hated the cold and kept his apartment at an almost unbearable level of tropical heat, which his visitors quietly suffered. When conversing with foreigners, Humboldt spoke in several languages at the same time, switching within a sentence between German, French, Spanish and English. Although he was losing his hearing, he had lost none of his wit. First comes deafness, he joked, and then ‘imbecility’. The only reason for his ‘celebrity’, he told an acquaintance, was because he had lived to such an old age. Many visitors commented on his boyish humour, such as his much repeated joke about his chameleon which was like ‘many clerics’, he said, in its ability to look with one eye to the heavens and with the other to the earth.

On the other, he indicts overconfidence and delusional optimism, saying, “People do things they have no business doing because they believe they’ll be successful.” Delusional optimism is a first cousin of Kahneman’s “planning fallacy,” in which planners chronically underestimate costs and overestimate benefits, because they ignore the baseline statistics for other projects that resemble theirs. Such optimism, he believes, can be corrected by exercises in which investors systematically remember and rehearse realistically how well similar business ventures have actually fared in the past.

But although the cliché says that power always corrupts, what is seldom said, but what is equally true, is that power always reveals. When a man is climbing, trying to persuade others to give him power, concealment is necessary: to hide traits that might make others reluctant to give him power, to hide also what he wants to do with that power; if men recognized the traits or realized the aims, they might refuse to give him what he wants. But as a man obtains more power, camouflage is less necessary. The curtain begins to rise. The revealing begins.

As a boy, friends recall, “he was always repeating” the salesman’s credo that “You’ve got to believe in what you’re selling”; decades later, in his retirement, he would say: “What convinces is conviction. You simply have to believe in the argument you are advancing; if you don’t, you’re as good as dead. The other person will sense that something isn’t there.” And Lyndon Johnson could make himself believe in an argument even if that argument did not accord with the facts, even if it was clearly in conflict with reality. He “would quickly come to believe what he was saying even if it was clearly not true,” his aide Joseph Califano would write. “It was not an act,” George Reedy would say. “He had a fantastic capacity to persuade himself that the ‘truth’ which was convenient for the present was the truth and anything that conflicted with it was the prevarication of enemies. He literally willed what was in his mind to become reality.” He would refuse to hear any facts which conflicted with that “reality,” to listen to anyone who disagreed with him.

If something is scarce, it will seem more desirable and more valuable to us. Showing a limited quantity in stock, or a limited time frame that something is available, invokes scarcity. Scarcity motivates us to act. Not only products can be scarce. Access to information might be hard to get, and therefore will make that information seem more valuable to us as well.

It seems that if we make our choice unconsciously, without conscious processing, then we stick with it over time. If we spend more time and logically analyze why we’re choosing what we’re choosing, we’re less satisfied over time with our choices.

You can find any photo with only a few steps.” Which product would you buy? You’d likely buy the one that says “you” and “your.” This is not a conscious decision.

When the old brain sounds an alarm, all of our information processing and emotional processing systems are on high alert and highly functioning. This means that anything happening while we’re on high alert will be processed deeply and emotionally in our memory (Medina, 2008). There is an entire branch of marketing now focusing on activating the old brain and then feeding it product information. As such, there are television commercials that use a dangerous situation (for example, a car chase) that culminates with someone receiving a particular brand of soda or a particular credit card.

Tacs spoke a Hunnish word. “I don’t know what Germans call them. The spirits of people who have died at night, in the snow. All they can do is try to lure people out into the storm. If you went out you would freeze to death. Your spirit would take the place of the one that lured you out and that spirit would rest forever but you would have to go on calling until you found someone to take your place.” “But what did they do?” Dietric said. “They died in the snow, at night, alone. And their spirits got caught in the wind. It moves so fast they can’t come down out of the storm, they are blown along and along forever, until they can catch someone and pull themselves down out of the wind.” “But what did they do? Did they sin? Why are they punished like that?” Tacs’ eyebrows rose and lowered again. “They died at night, in the snow.” Dietric hunched his shoulders. His mind was numb with the possibility that people could be condemned for nothing but accident. He had always assumed that only bad people were punished. Sinking his head down between his shoulders, he burrowed closer into the packed humanity around him, down out of the wind.

We actually have more than one persona. We have different personas for different aspects of ourselves in relation to others. For example, there is a persona we have as a husband or wife, another persona we have as a parent, another persona at work, and yet another persona that defines our relationship with the neighborhood we live in. We make decisions based on staying true to our personas. Most of this decision-making based on personas happens unconsciously.

A certain generation in the future could have disproportionate power over the future of humanity. So although it may sound as if we would be taking control of our desires, in fact once we change our desires, the ones we then have would drive what we did next. Bostrom agrees. ‘Yeah. I think that, partly for that reason, the modifications that affect our emotions, values and preferences are ones we should be particularly careful with, because if you get it wrong, according to our current lights even, you might not then want to change it back. You’d have the capability of changing it back, you’d have the technology, but you wouldn’t have the desire.

But if we are patterns of thought, then other people’s patterns can start to be mirrored in our own brains. We internalise their ways of thinking and in that sense parts of them live in us. There is not ‘an unbridgeable gap between two such people. Each of them is instead spread out into the other one, and each of them lives partially in the other.’9 This even provides for a kind of impermanent afterlife. Like an eclipsed sun, ‘when someone dies, they leave a glowing corona behind them, an afterglow in the souls of those who were close to them … When, eventually, all those close ones have died as well, then all the embers will have gone cold, and at that last point, it’s “ashes to ashes and dust to dust”.’10

Being “disputatious,” he concluded, was “a very bad habit” because contradicting people produced “disgusts and perhaps enmities.” Later in his life he would wryly say of disputing: “Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinburgh.”

Around that time, Franklin developed a method for making difficult decisions. “My way is to divide a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one Pro and the other Con,” he later recalled. Then he would list all the arguments on each side and weigh how important each was. “Where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out; if I find a reason pro equal to some two reasons con, I strike out the three.” By this bookkeeper’s calculus, it became clear to him “where the balance lies.”

Being was somewhat distant and uninvolved in our daily travails. “I imagine it great vanity in me to suppose that the Supremely Perfect does in the least regard such an inconsiderable nothing as man,” he wrote.

Junto talk stressed that it was socially useful for people to believe in the version of divine providence and free will that he proposed: “This religion will be a powerful regulator of our actions, give us peace and tranquility within our own minds, and render us benevolent, useful and beneficial to others.”

First he made a list of twelve virtues he thought desirable, and to each he appended a short definition: Temperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. Order: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time. Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve. Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; (i.e., waste nothing). Industry: Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions. Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly. Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty. Moderation: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation. Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. Chastity: Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation.

A Quaker friend “kindly” informed him that he had left something off: Franklin was often guilty of “pride,” the friend said, citing many examples, and could be “overbearing and rather insolent.” So Franklin added “humility” to be the thirteenth virtue on his list. “Imitate Jesus and Socrates.”

writes social theorist David Brooks. “These are not heroic virtues. They don’t fire the imagination or arouse the passions like the aristocratic love of honor. They are not particularly spiritual virtues. But they are practical and they are democratic.”

The set of virtues was also, as Edmund Morgan and others have pointed out, somewhat selfish. It did not include benevolence or charity, for example.

Mastering all of these thirteen virtues at once was “a task of more difficulty than I had imagined,” Franklin recalled. The problem was that “while my care was employed in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another.” So he decided to tackle them like a person who, “having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time.”

Humility was also a problem. “I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it,” he wrote, echoing what he had said about how he had acquired the appearance of industry by carting his own paper through the streets of Philadelphia.

“There is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride; disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself.”

found that people were reluctant to support a “proposer of any useful project that might be supposed to raise one’s reputation.” So he put himself “as much as I could out of sight” and gave credit for the idea to his friends. This method worked so well that “I ever after practiced it on such occasions.” People will eventually give you the credit, he noted, if you don’t try to claim it at the time. “The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid.”

Franklin decided to win him over: I did not, however, aim at gaining his favor by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favor of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I returned it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favor. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, “He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.”14

For centuries, the devastating scourge of lightning had generally been considered a supernatural phenomenon or expression of God’s will. At the approach of a storm, church bells were rung to ward off the bolts. “The tones of the consecrated metal repel the demon and avert storm and lightning,” declared St. Thomas Aquinas. But even the most religiously faithful were likely to have noticed this was not very effective. During one thirty-five-year period in Germany alone during the mid-1700s, 386 churches were struck and more than one hundred bell ringers killed. In Venice, some three thousand people were killed when tons of gunpowder stored in a church was hit. As Franklin later recalled to Harvard professor John Winthrop, “The lightning seems to strike steeples of choice and at the very time the bells are ringing; yet still they continue to bless the new bells and jangle the old ones whenever it thunders. One would think it was now time to try some other trick.”8
